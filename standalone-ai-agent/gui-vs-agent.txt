GUI Chat vs Standalone Agent:

🎭 GUI Chat (RugBot in Ollama):
   - Just text conversations
   - No real actions possible
   - Like talking to a knowledgeable friend

🤖 Standalone Agent:
   - Actual blockchain transactions
   - Real money movement
   - Autonomous operation
   - Earnings tracking

The GUI is the 'planning phase', the agent is the 'execution phase'!
