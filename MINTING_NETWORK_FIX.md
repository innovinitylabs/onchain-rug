# Minting Network Fix

## Critical Issue Fixed

The minting component was using a **hardcoded contract address** from environment variables instead of detecting the user's connected network. This caused minting transactions to be sent to the wrong contract when users were on a different network.

### The Problem

**Before the fix:**
- User connects to **Shape Sepolia** (Chain ID: 11011)
- User tries to mint an NFT
- Minting component uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAIN_RUGS_CONTRACT` (hardcoded to Base Sepolia address)
- **Transaction sent to Base Sepolia contract instead of Shape Sepolia!**
- User's ETH sent to wrong network ‚ùå

### The Solution

Updated `components/Web3Minting.tsx` to:
1. Import `contractAddresses` mapping and `config`
2. Detect current `chainId` from user's wallet
3. Use network-specific contract address: `contractAddresses[chainId]`
4. Display current network in UI
5. Warn users if contract not deployed on their network

---

## Changes Made

### File: `components/Web3Minting.tsx`

#### 1. Added Imports
```typescript
import { shapeSepolia, shapeMainnet, contractAddresses } from '@/lib/web3'
import { config } from '@/lib/config'
```

#### 2. Added Network-Specific Contract Detection
```typescript
// Get contract address for current network
const contractAddress = contractAddresses[chainId] || config.contracts.onchainRugs
```

#### 3. Updated All Contract References
**Before:**
```typescript
address: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAIN_RUGS_CONTRACT as `0x${string}`
```

**After:**
```typescript
address: contractAddress as `0x${string}`
```

#### 4. Enhanced Logging
```typescript
console.log('Minting with optimized data:', {
  contract: contractAddress,
  chainId: chainId,
  network: chainId === 84532 ? 'Base Sepolia' : chainId === 11011 ? 'Shape Sepolia' : 'Unknown',
  // ... rest of data
})
```

#### 5. Improved UI Messages
```typescript
// Shows current network and contract address
‚úÖ Ready: 0xa435...4a8
Network: Base Sepolia

// Or when no contract available:
‚ö†Ô∏è Contract not deployed on this network
Network: Shape Sepolia
Please switch to a supported network
```

## How It Works Now

### Network Detection Flow

1. **User connects wallet**
   - Wagmi's `useChainId()` detects the chain
   - Example: Base Sepolia = 84532

2. **Contract address selection**
   ```typescript
   const contractAddress = contractAddresses[chainId] || config.contracts.onchainRugs
   ```
   - Base Sepolia (84532) ‚Üí `0xa43532205Fc90b286Da98389a9883347Cc4064a8`
   - Shape Sepolia (11011) ‚Üí `0x5E63d07BDa3987da3A0CaCD69d829b9E11C1f325`

3. **Minting transaction**
   - Uses correct `contractAddress` for the network
   - Gas estimation uses correct contract
   - Transaction sent to correct network ‚úÖ

4. **UI feedback**
   - Displays current network
   - Shows correct contract address
   - Warns if contract not available on current network

## Example User Flows

### Flow 1: Minting on Base Sepolia
```
1. User connects wallet to Base Sepolia (84532)
2. Minting UI shows: "‚úÖ Ready: 0xa435...4a8 | Network: Base Sepolia"
3. User clicks "Mint NFT"
4. Transaction sent to 0xa43532205Fc90b286Da98389a9883347Cc4064a8 ‚úÖ
5. NFT minted on Base Sepolia ‚úÖ
```

### Flow 2: Switching to Shape Sepolia
```
1. User was on Base Sepolia
2. User switches wallet to Shape Sepolia (11011)
3. Minting UI updates: "‚úÖ Ready: 0x5E63...325 | Network: Shape Sepolia"
4. User clicks "Mint NFT"
5. Transaction sent to 0x5E63d07BDa3987da3A0CaCD69d829b9E11C1f325 ‚úÖ
6. NFT minted on Shape Sepolia ‚úÖ
```

### Flow 3: Unsupported Network
```
1. User connects to Ethereum Mainnet (1)
2. Minting UI shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Contract not deployed on this network"
3. Mint button disabled
4. User prompted to switch to supported network
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Base Sepolia Minting
```bash
1. Connect wallet to Base Sepolia
2. Verify UI shows: "Network: Base Sepolia"
3. Verify contract address: 0xa435...4a8
4. Mint an NFT
5. Check transaction on Base Sepolia explorer ‚úÖ
```

### Test 2: Shape Sepolia Minting
```bash
1. Switch wallet to Shape Sepolia
2. Verify UI updates: "Network: Shape Sepolia"
3. Verify contract address: 0x5E63...325
4. Mint an NFT
5. Check transaction on Shape Sepolia explorer ‚úÖ
```

### Test 3: Network Switching
```bash
1. Start on Base Sepolia
2. Note contract address shown
3. Switch to Shape Sepolia in wallet
4. Verify contract address changes automatically
5. Mint on Shape ‚Üí Should go to Shape contract ‚úÖ
```

## Network Support

| Network | Chain ID | Contract | Minting Support |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Base Sepolia** | 84532 | `0xa435...4a8` | ‚úÖ Active |
| **Shape Sepolia** | 11011 | `0x5E63...325` | ‚úÖ Active |

## Security Note

**This was a critical security issue!**

Users could have lost ETH by sending transactions to the wrong network's contract address. This fix ensures:

1. ‚úÖ Transactions always go to the correct network
2. ‚úÖ Users see which network they're minting on
3. ‚úÖ Clear warnings if contract not available on their network
4. ‚úÖ Prevents accidental cross-network transactions

---

## Summary

The minting component now:

1. **Detects the connected network** automatically
2. **Uses the correct contract address** for that network
3. **Shows network info** in the UI
4. **Prevents minting** on unsupported networks
5. **Updates automatically** when user switches networks

Users can now safely mint NFTs on any supported network without risk of sending transactions to the wrong contract! üéâ
