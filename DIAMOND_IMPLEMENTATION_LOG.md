**Date Started:** [Current Date]
**Branch:** diamonds-integration
**Reference:** diamond-3-hardhat (Hardhat) → Adapting to Foundry
**Status:** 🏗️ In Progress

## 🎯 Phase 1: Diamond Core Infrastructure (Day 1)

### Objectives
- [ ] Create Diamond.sol (core contract)
- [ ] Implement LibDiamond.sol (storage & utilities)
- [ ] Add DiamondCutFacet.sol (upgrade functionality)
- [ ] Create DiamondLoupeFacet.sol (introspection)
- [ ] Adapt from Hardhat to Foundry patterns
- [ ] Test basic diamond deployment

### Progress
- **Started:** [Time]
- **diamond-3-hardhat Analysis:**
  - Uses Hardhat + ethers.js deployment
  - Diamond.sol: Simple constructor calling LibDiamond
  - LibDiamond.sol: Complex storage management
  - FacetCut struct for upgrades
  - DiamondStorage struct with mappings
- **Foundry Adaptations Needed:**
  - Use forge script instead of hardhat deploy
  - Foundry test patterns instead of mocha/chai
  - Foundry console.log instead of hardhat console
  - Foundry deployment scripts

### Current Status
- ⏳ Analyzing reference implementation
- ⏳ Planning Foundry adaptations

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Diamond Core Contracts (Priority Order)
1. **LibDiamond.sol** - Diamond storage and utilities (most complex)
2. **Diamond.sol** - Main diamond contract (simple)
3. **DiamondCutFacet.sol** - Upgrade functionality
4. **DiamondLoupeFacet.sol** - Introspection functions
5. **DiamondInit.sol** - Initialization contract

### Rug-Specific Facets (Phase 2)
1. **RugNFTFacet** - ERC721 core + minting
2. **RugAgingFacet** - Dirt/texture aging system
3. **RugMaintenanceFacet** - Cleaning/restoration services
4. **RugCommerceFacet** - Withdraw/royalties/pricing
5. **RugAdminFacet** - Owner controls & limits
6. **RugLaunderingFacet** - Sale tracking & auto-cleaning

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each facet
- Integration tests for diamond cuts
- Foundry test patterns throughout

```

### Critical Components to Adapt
1. **LibDiamond.sol** - Diamond storage pattern
2. **FacetCut struct** - For upgrade operations
3. **DiamondStorage struct** - Central storage
4. **Function selectors** - For facet management
5. **Delegatecall pattern** - For facet execution

### Foundry-Specific Changes
- Replace `ethers.getContractFactory` → Foundry deployment
- Replace mocha/chai tests → Foundry tests
- Replace hardhat console → Foundry console
- Use forge script for deployment
