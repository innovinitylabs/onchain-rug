---

## Key Design Decisions

### Art-First Language
We deliberately avoided trading/financial terminology:
- "Showcase" instead of "List"
- "Interest" instead of "Offers/Bids"
- "Gallery" instead of "Portfolio/Inventory"
- "Collectors" instead of "Buyers/Traders"
- "Pieces" instead of "NFTs/Tokens"

### Technical Choices
1. **ETH-only payments** - Simpler, more accessible
2. **Escrow-based offers** - Guaranteed funds, better UX
3. **Auto-extend auctions** - Prevents sniping
4. **Configurable fees** - Flexibility for future adjustments
5. **Automatic laundering** - Seamless integration with existing mechanics

## Art-First Philosophy

This marketplace is designed for **art collectors**, not traders:

- Language emphasizes curation and appreciation
- Focus on piece quality (condition, maintenance, history)
- Unique mechanics (laundering) tied to art appreciation
- Clean, gallery-like UI
- No speculation terminology
- Emphasis on the generative art aspect

The marketplace facilitates **collecting and sharing art**, not speculation.

---

## Maintenance

The marketplace integrates seamlessly with OnchainRugs' unique mechanics:
- Dirt accumulation visible in marketplace
- Aging levels displayed
- Frame achievements highlighted
- Laundering history tracked
- High-value sales trigger automatic cleaning

This creates a **living art market** where pieces have history and character.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to testnet** (Shape Sepolia)
2. **Test all flows** (see checklist above)
3. **Deploy to mainnet** (when ready)
4. **Optional: Add event indexing** for full activity feed
5. **Optional: Build analytics dashboard** (Phase 2)
